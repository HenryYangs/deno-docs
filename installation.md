## Installation

Deno works on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Deno is a single binary executable. It
has no external dependencies.

### Download and install

[deno_install](https://github.com/denoland/deno_install) provides convenience
scripts to download and install the binary.

Using Shell (macOS and Linux):

```shell
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```

Using PowerShell (Windows):

```shell
iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

Using [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) (Windows):

```shell
scoop install deno
```

Using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/deno) (Windows):

```shell
choco install deno
```

Using [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/deno) (macOS):

```shell
brew install deno
```

Using [Cargo](https://crates.io/crates/deno) (Windows, macOS, Linux):

```shell
cargo install deno
```

Deno binaries can also be installed manually, by downloading a zip file at
[github.com/denoland/deno/releases](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases).
These packages contain just a single executable file. You will have to set the
executable bit on macOS and Linux.

### Testing your installation

To test your installation, run `deno --version`. If this prints the Deno version
to the console the installation was successful.

Use `deno help` to see help text documenting Deno's flags and usage. Use
`deno help <subcommand>` for subcommand-specific flags.

### Updating

To update a previously installed version of Deno, you can run `deno upgrade`.
This will fetch the latest release from
[github.com/denoland/deno/releases](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases),
unzip it, and replace your current executable with it.
